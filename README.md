## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- npm
- pip

### 1. Clone the repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/keyyard/spendee.git
cd spendee
```
### 2. Install dependencies
- Run task: `Install All Dependencies` in VS Code or manually:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add your Clerk API keys:
```plaintext
CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api
CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key
```
### 4. Run the application
- Run Task: `Dev` in VS Code or manually:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm start
```
```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Testing
#### Frontend
- Run Task: `Frontend Test` in VS Code or manually:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm test
```
#### Backend
- Run Task: `Backend Test` in VS Code or manually:
```powershell
cd backend
pytest tests
```
## Strengths
- **Modern Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns, modular components
- **Developer Experience** - One-command setup, intelligent VS Code tasks
- **Cross-Platform** - Write once, run on iOS, Android, and web
- **AI-powered** - Natural language financial insights
- **Type Safety** - End-to-end type checking
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Automated tests for both frontend and backend

## Known Limitations
- **AI Assistant costs** - Requires OpenAI API key (potentially incurring costs)
- **No offline support** - Cloud-first approach requires network connectivity
- **Mobile/web parity** - Some features may have slight differences between platforms
- **Limited multi-user features** - Primarily designed for individual use
- **Not centralized Styling** - creating ``global.css`` classes with @apply for Tailwind classes is not rendering on Expo somehow, so i used direct styling, and styled components.
